\section{A case study}
\label{sec:cas}

We present an example of creating two FLC controllers with jFuzzyLogic. This case study is focused on the development of the wall following robot as explained in \cite{Mucientes2010}. Wall following behavior is well known in mobile robotics. It is frequently used for the exploration of unknown indoor environments and for the navigation between two points in a map. 

The main requirement of a good wall-following controller is to maintain a suitable distance from the wall that is being followed. The robot should also move as fast as possible, while avoiding sharp movements, making smooth and progressive turns and changes in velocity.

In our fuzzy control system, the input variables are: 
	i) normalized distances from the robot to the right ($RD$) and left walls ($DQ$); 
	ii) orientation with respect to the wall ($O$); and 
	iii) linear velocity ($V$). 

The output variables in this controller are the normalized linear acceleration ($LA$) and the angular velocity ($AV$). The linguistic partitions are shown in Figure~\ref{f:robotVars} which are comprised by linguistic terms with uniformly distributed triangular membership functions giving meaning to them.

\vspace*{10pt}

In order to implement the controller, the first step is to declare the input and output variables and to define the fuzzy sets. Variables are defined in \textit{VAR\_INPUT} and \textit{VAR\_OUTPUT} sections. Fuzzy sets are defined in \textit{FUZZIFY} blocks for input variables and \textit{DEFUZZIFY} blocks for output variables.

One \textit{FUZZIFY} block is used for each input variable. Each \textit{TERM} line within a \textit{FUZZIFY} block defines a linguistic term and its corresponding membership function.  In this example all membership functions are triangular, so they are defined using the \textit{'trian'} keyword, followed by three parameters defining left, center and right points (e.g. \textit{`trian 1 2 3'}).

Output variables define their membership functions within \textit{DEFUZZIFY} blocks. Linguistic terms and membership functions are defined using the \textit{TERM} keyword as previously described for input variables. In this case we also add parameters to select the defuzzyfication method. The statement \textit{'METHOD : COG'} indicates that we are using 'Center of gravity'. The corresponding Java code generated for the first step is as follows:

\vspace*{10pt}

\begin{alltt}
VAR\_INPUT
	rd : REAL;			// Right distance
	dq : REAL;			// Distance quotient
	o  : REAL;			// Orientation. Note: 'or' is a reserved word
	v  : REAL;			// Velocity
END\_VAR

VAR\_OUTPUT
	la : REAL;			// Linear acceleration
	av : REAL;			// Angular velocity
END\_VAR

	TERM L  := trian 0 0 1;
	TERM M  := trian 0 1 2;
	TERM H  := trian 1 2 3;

END\_FUZZIFY

	TERM L := trian 0 0 2;
	TERM H := trian 0 2 2;
END\_FUZZIFY

FUZZIFY o
	TERM HL := trian -45 -45 -22.5;
	TERM LL := trian -45 -22.5 0;
	TERM Z  := trian -22.5 0 22.5;
	TERM LR := trian 0 22.5 45;
	TERM HR := trian 22.5 45 45;
END\_FUZZIFY

FUZZIFY v
	TERM L := trian 0 0 1;
	TERM H := trian 0 1 1;
END\_FUZZIFY

	TERM Z   := trian -0.25 0 0.25;
	TERM SA  := trian 0 0.25 0.5;
	TERM MA  := trian 0.25 0.5 0.75;
	TERM HA  := trian 0.5 0.75 1;
	TERM VHA := trian 0.75 1 1;
	METHOD : COG;			// Center of Gravity
	DEFAULT := 0;
END\_DEFUZZIFY

DEFUZZIFY av
	TERM VHR := trian -1 -1 -0.75;
	TERM HR  := trian -1 -0.75 -0.5;
	TERM MR  := trian -0.75 -0.5 -0.25;

	TERM Z   := trian -0.25 0 0.25;
	TERM SL  := trian 0 0.25 0.5;
	TERM ML  := trian 0.25 0.5 0.75;
	TERM HL  := trian 0.5 0.75 1;
	TERM VHL := trian 0.75 1 1;
	METHOD : COG;

These membership functions can be plotted by running jFuzzyLogic with the FCL file generated as argument (e.g. \texttt{java -jar jFuzzyLogic.jar robotCOR.fcl}). 
The corresponding FCL file for this case study is available for download as one of the examples provided in jFuzzyLogic package (\texttt{jfuzzylogic.sourceforge.net}).

The second step is to define the rules used for inference. They are defined in \textit{RULEBLOCK} statements. For the wall-following robot controller, we used 'minimum' connection method (\textit{AND : MIN}), minimum activation method (\textit{ACT : MIN}), and maximum accumulation method (\textit{ACCU : MAX}).  We implemented the rule bases generated in~\cite{mucientes2009learning} by the methods COR~\cite{Casillas02} and WCOR~\cite{Alc06}. Each entry in the rule bases was converted to a single FCL rule. Within each rule, the antecedent (i.e. the \textit{IF} part) is composed of the input variables connected by \textit{`AND'} operators. Since there are more than one output variable, we can specify multiple consequents (i.e. \textit{THEN} part) separated by semicolons. Finally, we add the desired weight using the \textit{`with'} keyword followed by the weight. This completes the implementation of a controller for a wall-following robot using FCL and jFuzzyLogic. The Java codes generated for COR and WCOR are the following:

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we have described jFuzzyLogic, an open source Java library for fuzzy systems which allow us to design FLCs following the standard IEC 61131.
It allows us to reduce programming work and extend the range of possible users applying fuzzy systems and FLCs.

We have shown a case study to illustrate the use of jFuzzyLogic. 
In this case, we developed an FLC controller for wall-following behavior in a robot.
The example shows how FCL can be used to easily implement fuzzy logic systems.

The jFuzzyLogic software package is continuously being updated and improved. 
At the moment, we are developing an implementation of a C/C++ compiler for fuzzy inference systems. 
This will allow easy implementation with embedded control systems using different processors.
